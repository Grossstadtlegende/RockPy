# RockPy
is a rock and paleomagnetism package. It combines many functions, that I have found useful over the years. 
It is intended to be easily user editable (e.g. creating new measurement types). 
The core (RockPy.core) of the package, however, is rather complicated and should not be edited.

## Design Philosophy
### Top down user approach
    1. Study
    2. Sample
    3. Measurement
    
### Bottom up code approach:
The lowest class contains the most important methods

    1. Measurement
    2. Sample
    3. Study 


## `study`
### The `RockPy.core.study` base-class

## `sample`
### The `RockPy.core.sample` base-class

## `measurement`
### The `RockPy.core.measurement` base-class
### implemented `mtypes`

## `ftype`
### The `RockPy.core.ftype` base-class
### implemented ftypes
